A lil number guesser game.

1. First we import random. This is a part of python's library.

**Special
- We are able to grab other libraries, but we must install them
in the terminal first.

2. Then we use random. Like this:
random.randrange(start, end)
The start is inclusive, and the end does not include that number.
Like this -> [0, 11)

**Special
- randrange has the upper bound
- randint includes both numbers.

**Special
- make sure to convert the answer to an int when you check it with the random int.
- incorporate a while loop

3. Let's ask the user for the top of the range.
4. Check if the input is a digit.
5. Check if its above 0.
6. Assign a random number using this top of range.
7. Ask for the user's input.
8. Create a while loop to keep asking the user for the input.

**Special
This will not work:

answer = input("What do you think the number is? ")

while int(answer) != random_number:
    answer = input("Nope! Guess again: ")

This is because we aren't checking if the user types something that's not a digit.
So we do this instead:

9. Have the while loop be 'while True:'
10. Ask the user for the input.
11. Check to see if digit.
12. Check to see if they guess the number.
13. Should look like this:
while True:
    user_guess = input("Take a guess: ")
    if user_guess.isdigit():
        user_guess = int(user_guess)
    else:
        print("Please time a number next time.")
        continue

    if user_guess == random_number:
        print("You got it!")
        break
    else:
        print("You got it wrong!")

14. Let's add a feature that counts how many times the person guesses wrong.
15. We just initialize the guess variable before the while loop,
and increment it inside the loop.
16. We can print the guesses at the end like this:

print("You got it in", guesses, "guesses")

17. We can add an element to tell them whether their guess is greater
than or less than the answer. Like this:

    if user_guess == random_number:
        print("You got it!")
        break
    elif user_guess > random_number:
        print("You were above the number.")
    else:
        print("You are below the number.")
